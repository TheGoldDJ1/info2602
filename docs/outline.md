## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course covers the design, implementation and testing of web-based applications and the incorporation of a variety of digital media into these applications. Students are exposed to a range of web technologies, both client-side and server-side. The course will be delivered using a combination of lectures, blended learning, case studies and various online resources. Assignments will take the form of written examinations and lab examinations.


## COURSE RATIONALE

In the Information Technology degree this is the first course that focuses on developing complex applications and services through the combination of both client-side and server-side programming. The main reason for offering the course is that employers expect the UWI graduate to be competent with writing Web Applications since most businesses are seeking to become digital firms.
